# CPP-Modules
The goal of these modules is to introduce Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of the C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. At 42 we choose C++ since itâ€™s derived from C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
